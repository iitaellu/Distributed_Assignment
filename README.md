# Distributed_Assignment

In this assignment I created simple distributed system. It is simple notebooks program, where user can write notes by topic. If topic user wants to write is already exists, new note will be written under that topic. If topic is new, the new topic with its contect will be written under other topics. User can also search by topic. If topic dosen't exists,program tells that, but if there is wanted topic, program prints all notes under it. All topics and them contents are written in XML file named db.xml.

There is video of my program: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Oa8VgjDaZcPr7lmY0b1E1ZjIkcVwmI5g/view?usp=sharing
